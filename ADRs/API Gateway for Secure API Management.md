# API Gateway for Secure API Management

## Context
Secure and efficient management of APIs is essential for the interaction between FishWatch's microservices and external clients.

## Decision
Utilize Amazon API Gateway as the centralized point for managing, securing, and monitoring all APIs within the FishWatch platform.

## Considered Options
1. Self-managed API management layer
2. Amazon API Gateway
3. Azure API Management

## Rationale
Amazon API Gateway is chosen for its integration with AWS services, scalability, and features like authentication, rate limiting, and usage policies.

## Implications
- Ties the solution somewhat closer to the AWS ecosystem.
- Simplifies API management but introduces a dependency on a managed service.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
Facilitates secure and scalable API interactions while leveraging AWS's managed services for ease of management and operational efficiency.

## Mapped Requirements
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensures secure access to APIs with built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Supports the ability to handle varying loads of API calls efficiently.
