# Disaster Recovery and Data Backup Strategy

## Context
Ensuring data integrity and system availability in the event of a disaster is critical for the FishWatch system's operation and reliability.

## Decision
Adopt AWS services for disaster recovery and data backup, utilizing automated snapshots, cross-region replication, and AWS Disaster Recovery services.

## Considered Options
1. On-premises backup and disaster recovery solutions
2. Cloud-based disaster recovery and data backup with AWS
3. Hybrid disaster recovery and backup strategies

## Rationale
Cloud-based disaster recovery and data backup with AWS is chosen for its scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Implications
- Relies on AWS for critical data recovery and backup capabilities.
- Reduces the need for on-premises backup infrastructure.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
This decision ensures high availability and resilience of the FishWatch system, safeguarding against data loss and minimizing downtime.

## Mapped Requirements
- **Reliability**: Critical for maintaining continuous system operation.
- **Security and Privacy**: Ensures data is securely backed up and recoverable.
