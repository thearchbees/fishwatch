# Data Lake for Historical Data Analysis

## Context
Storing and analyzing vast amounts of historical data is necessary for identifying trends and making informed decisions.

## Decision
Implement a data lake using Amazon S3 to store historical sensor data and video feeds, providing a scalable solution for data management.

## Considered Options
1. Traditional data warehouses
2. Data lakes (Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage)
3. On-premises storage solutions

## Rationale
A data lake on Amazon S3 is chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and compatibility with various data analysis tools.

## Implications
- Requires careful data management to avoid a "data swamp."
- Integration with analysis tools is necessary for effective data utilization.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
The data lake provides a centralized repository for historical data, enabling comprehensive analysis over time.

## Mapped Requirements
- **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 offers scalable and cost-effective storage for large volumes of data.
- **Insights and Analytics**: The data lake supports in-depth analysis of historical data for generating insights.
