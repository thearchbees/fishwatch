# Data Processing Framework for Real-Time Analytics

## Context
The FishWatch system requires the capability to process and analyze data in real time to enable immediate actions based on water quality and fish health metrics.

## Decision
Implement Apache Kafka for stream processing, coupled with Apache Flink for real-time data analytics, to facilitate the processing of live data streams.

## Considered Options
1. Batch Processing only
2. Real-Time Stream Processing with Apache Kafka
3. Complex Event Processing (CEP) with Apache Flink

## Rationale
The combination of Apache Kafka and Apache Flink is selected for their efficiency in handling high-volume data streams and supporting complex real-time analytics.

## Implications
- Requires expertise in stream processing architectures and technologies.
- Infrastructure must be scaled appropriately to handle data throughput.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
This decision enables the FishWatch system to provide timely insights and alerts, enhancing the decision-making process for fish farm management.

## Mapped Requirements
- **Real-time Analysis/Data Processing**: Critical for processing sensor data as it is generated.
- **Scalability**: The chosen technologies support scaling to accommodate data growth.
