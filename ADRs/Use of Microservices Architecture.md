# Microservices Architecture

## Context
The FishWatch system requires a scalable, maintainable, and flexible architecture to accommodate diverse and evolving needs, with a focus on real-time data processing and responsiveness.

## Decision
Adopt an event-driven microservices architecture, enabling services to react to events and changes in real-time, and allowing for independent scaling and development of each service.

## Considered Options
1. Monolithic Architecture
2. Microservices Architecture (REST-based)
3. Event-Driven Microservices Architecture
4. Serverless Architecture

## Rationale
An event-driven microservices architecture was chosen for its ability to handle real-time data efficiently, improve system responsiveness, and provide better scalability and flexibility compared to traditional REST-based microservices.

## Implications
- Requires an event-broker (such as Apache Kafka) to manage events.
- Increased complexity in service coordination and event handling.
- Potential challenges in tracing and debugging due to asynchronous communication.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
This architecture facilitates real-time data processing and enhances system scalability, but it requires careful design and management of event flows and service interactions.

## Mapped Requirements
- **Real-time Analysis/Data Processing**: Supports efficient processing of real-time data through event-driven communication.
- **Scalability**: Allows for independent scaling of services based on event processing demands.
- **Extensibility**: Facilitates the addition of new services and features by subscribing to relevant events.
