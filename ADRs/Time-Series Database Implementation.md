# Time-Series Database Implementation

## Context
Efficient storage and querying of time-stamped sensor data are crucial for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Decision
Implement InfluxDB as the time-series database for its high performance and suitability for time-stamped data.

## Considered Options
1. Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
2. NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB)
3. Time-Series Database (e.g., InfluxDB)

## Rationale
InfluxDB is selected for its optimized handling of time-series data and scalability.

## Implications
- Requires familiarity with its querying language and data modeling.
- Limited support for complex relational queries.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
Enhances real-time analytics and historical data analysis but requires specialized knowledge for effective use.

## Mapped Requirements
- **Real-time Analysis/Data Processing**: InfluxDB supports the real-time processing of sensor data.
- **Scalability**: InfluxDB's scalability aligns with the system's need to handle growing data volumes.
