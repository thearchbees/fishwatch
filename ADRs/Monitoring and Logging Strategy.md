# Monitoring and Logging Strategy

## Context
Effective monitoring and logging are crucial for maintaining the health and performance of the FishWatch system.

## Decision
We will use Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for dashboards, and the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

## Considered Options
1. Prometheus and Grafana
2. ELK Stack
3. InfluxDB and Chronograf

## Rationale
Prometheus and Grafana are chosen for their powerful monitoring and visualization capabilities. The ELK Stack is selected for its comprehensive logging and analysis features.

## Implications
- Requires setup and maintenance of monitoring and logging infrastructure.
- Integration with other system components is necessary for comprehensive coverage.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
The chosen tools will provide real-time monitoring, customizable dashboards, and centralized logging, enhancing the operational visibility of the FishWatch system.

## Mapped Requirements
- **System Accessibility and Compatibility**: Ensures the system's performance and health are accessible and monitored across different environments.
- **Reliability**: Monitoring and logging contribute to the system's reliability by enabling proactive issue detection and resolution.
